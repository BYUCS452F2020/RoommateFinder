I am very much interested in working on this project because it can help solve a very common problem for college students. Trying to find compatible roommates
can be very tricky, so I think there is a lot of potential for this project if we can make a successful app with a working database.

Seeing that the initial approach for the database is a Graph Database, I can contribute here by researching this particular database and seeing how it can be useful
for storing the data which people will need to provide or access to find potential roommates.
