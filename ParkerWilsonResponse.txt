I am very much interested in working on this project because it can help solve a very common problem for college students. Trying to find compatible roommates
can be very tricky, so I think there is a lot of potential for this project if we can make a successful app with a working database.

Business: I feel that the problem we are trying to solve is large enough that people would want to invest in app once they see how it can be an effective solution.
The fact that facebook already tries to solve this problem shows that there is a demand for software that helps people find compatible roommates.

Legal: Should this project progress beyond the class, some of the main legal issues I can predict based on my research are liscencing, patents, and product
liabilities. Still, these are common problems for every startup project. To ensure that these issues are properly addressed, I can do further research on these 
topics and share my findings with Travis so that we can design the app in accordance with legalities.

Technical:
Seeing that the initial approach for the database is a Graph Database, I can contribute here by researching this particular database and seeing how it can be useful
for storing the data which people will need to provide or access to find potential roommates. I can also offer my experience in web development for building the
different parts of the app.
