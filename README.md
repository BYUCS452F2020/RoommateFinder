Travis Grahm (Leader):
Since you've been in College, how many times have you moved? If you live anywhere but with your parents, then it's probably quite a bit. If you're ever unfortunate enough, you may find yourself living in an apartment with a group of other students where the rent is shared. If a student moves suddenly because of irresponsiblility or other extenuating circumstances, your share of the rent may go up to compensate for their departure. Resulting in a need to fill a vacant spot. When this happened to me a couple of months ago, I found it difficult to find anyone. There weren't any apps but Facebook that I could really use, even then, it was a sketchy experience. This is why there is a need for an app that provides ratings, feedback, and viable prospective roommates.
