list the servers/machines used: It will be an Android application so a cell phone will suffice, no server is needed because we are using AWS
which relational database software are you using: Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) https://www.baeldung.com/aws-aurora-rds-java
what implementation languages are using for each part, for example
database server, SQL
client machine, Java
what is the nature of the connections between the pieces (bandwidth, latency, protocol, etc.) It's nothing too crazy. The android phone will communicate with AWS services and then receive data from aws. Other minor details such as scaling is taking care of with AWS
